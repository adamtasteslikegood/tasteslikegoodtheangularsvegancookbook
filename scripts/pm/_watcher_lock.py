"""Single-writer lock for the PM daemon's Confluence file watcher.

Why this exists
---------------
Every agent session (Claude Code, Copilot CLI, each background job, each git
worktree) spawns its own `pm_daemon.py` as an MCP stdio child. That is correct
for the MCP *tools* — each session needs its own server on its own pipes.

It is very wrong for the *watcher*. Each daemon also started a `watchdog`
Observer over the workspace, so N concurrent sessions meant N observers all
watching the same `specs/*.md` and all racing to PUT the same Confluence pages
on every save. Observed in the wild: 13 daemons, 13 observers. Duplicate and
interleaved Confluence writes are the failure mode, and version conflicts on the
page are how it surfaces.

The fix: the watcher is a singleton, elected by an exclusive `flock`. Every
daemon still serves MCP tools; only the lock holder runs an Observer.

Why flock and not a PID file
----------------------------
The kernel releases an `flock` when the holding process dies, however it dies —
SIGKILL, crash, machine losing power. There is no stale-lock cleanup path to get
wrong, which is exactly the bug a PID file would reintroduce (a dead session's
PID file blocking the watcher forever). The tradeoff is that flock is per-machine
and does not work across NFS, which is fine: the watcher is a local process
watching a local checkout.

Scope: the lock lives in the MAIN checkout, not the worktree. Worktrees share one
Confluence space, so the watcher must be a singleton across all of them; a
per-worktree lock would elect one watcher per worktree and reintroduce the race.

Standard-library only, so it stays importable before project dependencies are
installed (same constraint as _atlassian_guard.py).
