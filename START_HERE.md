## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before deploying:

```
Quick Verification:
□ npm install runs successfully
□ npm run build completes without errors
□ npm start starts the server
□ curl http://localhost:8080/api/health returns 200
□ Security headers present: curl -I http://localhost:8080/api/health

Rate Limiting Test:
□ Make 21 requests to /api/recipe
□ 21st request returns 429 (Too Many Requests)

Validation Test:
□ Empty prompt returns 400 (Bad Request)
□ Valid prompt returns 200 (Success)

Error Handling Test:
□ Error responses don't show stack traces
□ Error responses don't leak sensitive info

Logging Test:
□ Console shows request logs with timestamp/method/status/duration
```

## 🔒 Security Improvements Summary

**What's Protected:**

- ✅ DOS attacks (rate limiting)
- ✅ XSS attacks (security headers)
- ✅ Injection attacks (input validation)
- ✅ Information leakage (error handling)
- ✅ Memory exhaustion (payload limits)
- ✅ Blind deployments (request logging)

**What's Recommended:**

- ⚠️ HTTPS/TLS (critical for production)
- ⚠️ API Authentication (for access control)
- ⚠️ Error Monitoring (for incident response)
- ⚠️ CORS Configuration (for frontend safety)

## 🎓 Key Commands to Know

```bash
# Development
npm run dev                  # Start dev server

# Production
npm install                  # Install dependencies
npm run build               # Build for production
npm start                   # Start production server

# Testing
npm audit                   # Check for vulnerabilities

# Testing Features
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..21}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/recipe \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"prompt": "test"}'
  sleep 2
done

# Test validation (should fail with 400)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/recipe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": ""}'

# Check headers
curl -I http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Build Fails

```bash
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

### Rate Limit Too Strict

→ Edit `server/security.ts` and increase the limits

### Validation Errors

→ Check error message in response  
→ Adjust validation rules in `server/validation.ts`

### Performance Issues

→ Check request duration in console logs  
→ Review DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md troubleshooting section

### Errors Showing Sensitive Info

→ Check error handling in `server/index.ts`  
→ Should show generic message to client

**Detailed troubleshooting** → See `SECURITY_QUICKSTART.md`
